That type of information is best obtained from people who’ve actually tried to do this in the target region (Uganda). Also, it might help to look at the economic possibilities - exactly how many subsidised-fee clients per high-fee client? And how many high-fee clients are feasible to reach?\n- *Who might change my perspective that I haven’t talked to?* A nonprofit COO that’s tried to implement nonprofit operations between a high-income and a low-income area. Or a researcher or other scientist who’s tried to adapt mental health curriculum across many different regions.\n- *Which assumptions am I making that could be wrong?* It’s not prohibitively expensive to set up *physical* nonprofit operations in multiple regions, where one has a lack of connectivity. High-fee clients will be willing to pay, even if they find out that their fees are being used to subsidise other clients.
